# Hi there 👋

Welcome to System and Programming Lagnuage Virtual Meetup (SPLVM)

## 🌈 What is SPLVM?

SPLVM is an informal, collaborative gathering of enthusiasts and professionals in computer systems, networking, architectures and programming languages for an enriching exchange of knowledge and ideas.

Organized by by Wen Lin and Mossaka, SPLVM operates similarly to a university course. We follow and discuss online courses from various colleges (e.g. MIT OCW), with a tailored schedule that fits a large audience who are full-time employees, covering lectures, assignments, and readings.

## 🎯 Goals
The goal of SPLVM is to facilitate a highly effective learning environment where participants can deepen their understanding of computer systems and programming languages.

### Principles

Throughout the years, We’ve identified four foundational principles of creating such a highly effective learning environment: 

- **Engaging**
    - Engaging and interactive meetups are our backbone. We believe engaging is key to effective learning. We practice The Feynman Technique for studying and ensure every meetup is both educational and thought-provoking.
- **Relevant**
    - By focusing on both the “Big Ideas” and the latest advancements in this field, we want our knowledge-sharing meetups to stay relevant to the evolving field.
- **Collaborative**
    - Prioritize collaboration over competition. We commit to foster a supportive environment where knowledge and ideas are shared with everyone collectively.
- **Inclusive**
    - We want to hear the two sides of the same coin - diverse perspectives and experiences to enrich our discussions.

## 👥 Community

The group is **non-profit** and volunteer-driven. Both Wen and I do not gain any profits from organizing the meetups and we pledge to you that there will be no fees, ever, to participate in our meetups. We also promise you that all of our materials will be made available publicly to all, including the recordings of the meetups, the notes, the offline discussion and more.

Our community thrives on participant-led sessions and discussion, where everyone has opportunity to contribute, teach and learn. Everyone should feel comfortable sharing their thoughts, asking questions and providing constructive feedback. We deeply believe in our core values:

- **Mutual respect**
- **Passion for learning**
- **Commitment to freely sharing knowledge**

While currently a Chinese-only meetup, we are planning to expand the meetup to a broader audience.
